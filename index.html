         <h2> What is Coding </h2>
         <p> Electronic devices like cell phones, laptops, and tablets require code to function properly. Modern technology such as traffic lights, calculators, smart TVs, and cars use internal coding systems. Since computers do not communicate like humans, coding acts as a translator. Code converts human input into numerical sequences that computers understand. Once computers receive these messages, they complete assigned tasks such as changing font colors or centering an image. </p>
         <p> Coding can be defined as writing instructions for computers and other hardware. Computer language is different from human language. A human needs to learn “computer language” (commonly known as programming languages) to write programs that the computer can understand. Some “computer languages” include Python, Java, C, C++, and JavaScript.

         <h2> Who Created Coding </h2>
         <p> Ada Lovelace was the first to develop programming, which led to the digital revolution in which we can now do everything we do today. The first programming language was developed in 1883 when She met the great mathematician Charles Babbage, a Cambridge math professor who had invented the Difference Engine, a mechanical computer designed to produce mathematical tables automatically and error-free. Lovelace was influenced by the Difference Engine prototype and later became Babbage’s lifelong friend. Babbage had a new project in mind: the Analytical Engine, a far more advanced machine. In 1843, Lovelace translated a paper about the analytical engine written by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea. She also filled the paper with thousands of words of her own notes. </p>
          <p> The first computer program, according to computer historians, was the example she wrote of one such sequence—how to calculate Bernoulli numbers. Lovelace realized that the Analytical Engine could do a complex set of mathematical operations, and it is understood that she suggested it be used for manipulating “things other than numbers,” such as musical notation. Only a small piece of the Analytical Engine was ever built and Ada Lovelace died in 1852. Her fame lives on, however. She gave her name to the Ada programming language. Every year on the second Tuesday in October, the contributions of this women to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are celebrated on Ada Lovelace Day. </p>
