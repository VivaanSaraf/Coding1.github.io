         <h2> What is Coding </h2>
         <p> Electronic devices like cell phones, laptops, and tablets require code to function properly. Modern technology such as traffic lights, calculators, smart TVs, and cars use internal coding systems. Since computers do not communicate like humans, coding acts as a translator. Code converts human input into numerical sequences that computers understand. Once computers receive these messages, they complete assigned tasks such as changing font colors or centering an image. </p>
         <p> Coding can be defined as writing instructions for computers and other hardware. The computer is then able to read the instructions (called “programs”) and do what you have asked it to do.Computer language is different from human language. A human needs to learn “computer language” (commonly known as programming languages) to write programs that the computer can understand. Some “computer languages” include Python, Java, C, C++, and JavaScript.
